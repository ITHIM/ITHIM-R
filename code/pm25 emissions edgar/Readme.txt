Her email descriping data:


Dear Marko,
Thanks for your reply. Please find at the following link (ftp://anonymous: @edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/EDGARv4.3.2_PM2.5_TRO_TNR_data_2012) the EDGARv4.3.2 PM2.5 emissions of 2012 for road transport (TRO code name) separately for passenger cars (PC), heavy duty vehicles (HD), light duty vehicles (LD), buses (BS), motorcycles and mopeds (MC_MP). In addition, in case you need, I have prepared the gridmpas for inland waterways emissions which are distributed over rivers, ferries etc. (TNR_ILW) and for the remaining non road transport emissions (including railways, pipelines and other).
 
I confirm you that the sector classification refers to the IPCC guidelines 1996.
 
As you pointed out, transport emissions refer only to the exhausts and we apply country specific technology based emission factors from the EMEP/EEA guidebook, IPCC values and in some case literature values. We include the EURO standards information when applying the abatement measures to the uncontrolled emissions. 
Unfortunately, I do not have much experience for the brake wear emissions, so I would follow the suggestion of Christian or find some literature references.
 
I confirm you that the grid co-ordinate that you provide for the data represents lower left corner of the grid.
 
Since the EDGARv4.3.2 data are not yet published for the air pollutants (I am going to submit next month a paper and we will make our data publicly available but with some restrictions), it would be good if you could inform me about a possible publication from your side in order to properly cite the dataset and acknowledge the EDGAR contribution. Getting involved in your analysis and possible co-authorship is also appreciated.
 
I hope the data I am providing you will be helpful for your work and I am looking forward to have a feedback from your side.
 
Best regards
Monica
