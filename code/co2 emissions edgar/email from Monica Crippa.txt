Dear Rahul,
please find in attachment the CO2 emission maps for 2012.
 
Please let me know if everything is fine.
 
best regards

Thanks Monica!
 
1.	PM2.5 data that we have from you is for 2012, so I guess, same year for CO2
2.	Great news on the PM2.5 emissions: If you could answer this without too much of your time, how much is the percentage increment in PM2.5 transport emissions with the new additions? I just wanted to get a sense of how much error we may be introducing if we left brake and wear out. If there is something I can read, please let me know.
-Rahul
