#' Calculate total CO2 exposure per mode and scenario
#' 
#' Calculate total CO2 exposure for each mode and for each scenario based on the CO2 emissions inventory
#' 
#' This function performs the following steps:
#' 
#' \itemize{
#' \item calculate emission factors for each mode by dividing total emissions by distances travelled
#' 
#' \item calculate CO2 emissions for each mode in each scenario by multiplying the scenario distance times the emission factors
#' 
#' \item for modes without any assigned distance, use the CO2 emissions from the VEHICLE_INVENTORY instead
#' }
#' 
#' @param dist data frame of population travel from all scenarios
#' 
#' @return total CO2 exposure per mode
