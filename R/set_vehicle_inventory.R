  ##!! needs some work, both in terms of how it is built, and how it is used.
  ## the vehicle inventory lists the modes, their speeds, their emission factors, and the distance covered relative to cars.
  ## we use 'distance covered relative to cars' to impute distances for modes not included in the travel survey.
  ## these distances are either added to the synthetic trip set, which means they feature in the emission and injury calculations,
  ## or they are just added ad hoc to the emission calculation.
  ## For Accra, bus_driver and truck trips are added to Synthetic trips. Big truck and other are not, so are included in Emission calculation only.
  ## ratios are heuristic values taken from Delhi study. 
  ## They can become set variables, or random variables, but as present are constant as below. To make variable, move VEHICLE_INVENTORY definition to 'dist' calculation.
  ## N.B.: the mode list is the union of trip_modes and PM_EMISSION_INVENTORY. To omit an undesired mode, we'd need to set the distance ratio to 0.

  # emission factors come from global data. we will need at to have at least three versions of this, corresponding to different global regulatory standards. For Accra, we use `Euro III'
  # distance ratios can be provided as inputs to run_ithim_setup
  # we don't enter ratio values for cycling and pedestrian as it's assumed they will be covered by the survey.
