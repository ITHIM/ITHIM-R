#' Personal motorcycle trips for Chilean cities
#' 
#' Function to create personal motorcycle trips for some Chilean cities
#' 
#' This function is used to create personal motorcycle trips for those Chilean cities which do not have any 
#' motorcycle trips in their travel surveys. It uses as input the existing travel survey data for that city 
#' and the proportion of these travel survey trips that are to be added as additional new motorcycle trips. 
#' 
#' Based on an analysis of the motorcycle trips in the travel surveys of Santiago, San Antonio, 
#' Valparaiso and Puerto Montt it makes assumptions about the split between male and female 
#' motorcyclists, the number of trips per person and the truncated normal distributions of the
#' distances and ages of the drivers of the personal motorcycle trips to be added. It creates 
#' new trips by assuming that each such trip only has one stage, i.e. that the trip duration and distance
#' equals the stage duration and distance.
#' 
#' This function contains the following steps:
#' 
#' \itemize{
#' \item the characteristics of the motorcycle trips to be added are defined
#' 
#' \item set up the parameters of the truncated normal distributions for male and 
#'   female trip duration
#' 
#' \item set up the parameters of the truncated normal distributions for male and 
#'   female age ranges
#' 
#' \item find the number of male and female motorcycle trips to be added
#' 
#' \item divide the number of new male and female trips by 2 (= number of trips per person)
#'   to calculate the number of new participant ids to be added. If the number of male
#'   or female trips is odd, add an additional trip to get a trip number divisible by 2
#' 
#' \item sample from truncated normal distributions to find the duration of new trips (assuming
#'   that each trip only consists of one stage)
#' 
#' \item sample from the known age ranges to find the ages of the new male and female 
#'   motorcycle trips and create new motorcycle trips
