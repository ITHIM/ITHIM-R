#' Injury summary statistics
#'
#' Creates summarised injury tables for 'who hit who' and 'no other vehicle' fatality counts
#' for each casualty and strike mode combination (and age and sex combination where this information exists)
#'
#'
#' The function performs the following steps using the individual fatality injury input file:
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item The data is split into a WHW (who hit who) matrix where both casualty and strike mode are given
#'   and a NOV (no other vehicle) matrix where strike mode was set to NOV in ithim_load_data.R or
#'   no other vehicle was involved in the accident.
#'
#' \item If no age and gender information is given, then the counts are multiplied by the
#'   proportion of injuries relevant to the proportion of the population considered
#'   in the model (e.g. 15 - 65 year olds) based on the GBD data
#'
#' \item Data is aggregated by casualty and strike mode, and age and sex where such information exists
#'
#' \item Complete whw and nov matrices containing all casualty and strike (and age and sex)
#'   combinations are created with zero counts for those combinations with no fatalities
#'
#' \item a list of aggregated whw and nov matrices is set to the Global environment
