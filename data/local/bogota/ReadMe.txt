AKS, June 2022:

It looks like that at least the injury files have since been updated in the bogota folder on the repo and the updated data is what is read into the model. 

According to Daniel Gil:

"The Bogota folder has all the files that were processed by the team before I arrived at Cambridge and are the ones up-to-date. 
And Bogota WB has the files that I looked for and preprocess before joining Cam. For Latam paper I think you should discuss which 
datasets are more convenient, in my opinion it should be the ones that are in the Bogota Folder, because it has the latest changes.

I changed all of them (all files in the bogota folder):
- GBD: updated GBD for all places, the up-to-date is in the Bogota folder.
- PA: Same raw dataset, different way to compute PA. This was something I did before I joined Cam, so I think asking Lambed about 
the last version is better. I would say that the up-to-date is in the Bogota folder.
- Population: same source, different year. Up-to-date file is in the Bogota folder.

All in all, the up-to-date files are in the "Bogota" folder. I created the "Bogota_WB" folder because Ali asked me to, 
right in the beginning when I joined. I don't think it is needed anymore, so if you want to delete it is alright 
(besides, there is version control and you can always go back to see it)."

I.e. it is likely that none of the files in this folder are actually the ones that are used in the actual model
