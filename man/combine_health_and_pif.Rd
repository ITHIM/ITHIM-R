\title{Combine health and potential impact fraction (PIF)}
\usage{
combine_health_and_pif(pif_values, hc = DISEASE_BURDEN)
}
\arguments{
\item{pif_values}{vector of values of PIFs for all age and sex categories}

\item{hc}{data frame of current burden of disease}
}
\value{
estimated scenario burden of disease for all age and sex categories
}
\description{
Applies PIF calculated from relative risks (RRs) to the current observed health burden from the 
GBD to generate the scenario health burdens
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
- the current observed health burden for a particular disease is multiplied by the PIF, i.e
  the change in fraction in disease expected for the current scenario compared with the
  reference scenario
}
