\usage{
ithim_calculation_sequence(ithim_object, seed = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{ithim_object}{name of disease}

\item{seed}{}
}
\value{
ithim_object - list of items making up the ithim result
}
\description{
Ordered set of computations as part of ITHIM-Global that calculates the required output parameters
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:

\enumerate{

\item extract all lists and variables from the ithim_object list

\item  air pollution pathway:
   \itemize{
   \item calculate the PM2.5 exposure for each person in the synthetic population
     and PM2.5 emissions for each mode and scenario (\code{\link{scenario_pm_calculations()}})

   \item calculate the CO2 emissions for each mode and scenario (\code{\link{scenario_co2_calculations()}})

   \item assign relative risk to each person in the synthetic population for each disease
     related to PM pollution and each scenario based on the individual PM exposure
     levels (\code{\link{gen_ap_rr()}})
     }

\item  physical activity pathway:
   \itemize{
   \item calculate total mMETs for each person in the synthetic population (\code{\link{total_mmet()}})

   \item assign relative risk to each person in the synthetic population for each disease
     related to physical activity levels and each scenario based on the individual mMET
     values (\code{\link{gen_pa_rr()}})
   }

\item  physical activity and air pollution combined:
   \itemize{
   \item combine the PA and AP datasets by joining the two datasets. For disease affected by
     both PA and AP calculate the joined relative risk by multiplying the PA and AP
     relative risks (\code{\link{combined_rr_ap_pa()}})

   \item calculate the health burden (Yll and deaths) for each disease and age and sex
     category (\code{\link{health_burden()}}):
     \itemize{
     \item calculate the health burden (Yll and deaths) for each disease and age
       and sex category. Combine the AP and PA pathways for diseases affected
       by both AP and PA

     \item if running in constant mode also calculate the health burden for both the
       AP and PA pathways separately
       }
    }

\item  injury pathway:
   \itemize{
   \item estimate the injury deaths for the baseline and each scenario by age and sex category,
      also estimate the total injury deaths counts for the who-hit-whom and no-other-vehicle matrices
      by casualty (and strike) mode again for the baseline and each scenario (\code{\link{injuries_function2()}})
      \itemize{
     \item if running in constant mode include upper and lower confidence intervals
     }
   \item calculate the years of life lost from the injury deaths (\code{\link{injury_death_to_yll()}})
  }

\item  combine all pathways using the outputs from 3. and 4.:
   \itemize{
   \item combine the AP, PA and injury health burden data for ylls and deaths (\code{\link{join_hb_and_injury()}})
     for all diseases, injuries and scenarios
     }
}
}
