\description{
Function to create personal motorcycle trips for some Chilean cities
}
\details{
This function is used to create personal motorcycle trips for those Chilean cities which do not have any 
motorcycle trips in their travel surveys. It uses as input the existing travel survey data for that city and the proportion of these travel
survey trips that are to be added as additional new motorcycle trips. 

Based on an analysis of the motorcycle trips in the travel surveys of Santiago, San Antonio, 
Valparaiso and Puerto Montt it makes assumptions about the split between male and female 
motorcyclists, the number of trips per person and the truncated normal distributions of the distances and ages of the motorcycle trips
to be added. It creates new trips by assuming that each such trip only has one stage, i.e. that the trip duration and distance
equals the stage duration and distance.
