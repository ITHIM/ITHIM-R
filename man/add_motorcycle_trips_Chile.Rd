\description{
Function to create personal motorcycle trips for some Chilean cities
}
\details{
This function is used to create personal motorcycle trips for those Chilean cities which do not have any 
motorcycle trips in their travel surveys. It uses as input the existing travel survey data for that city 
and the proportion of these travel survey trips that are to be added as additional new motorcycle trips. 

Based on an analysis of the motorcycle trips in the travel surveys of Santiago, San Antonio, 
Valparaiso and Puerto Montt it makes assumptions about the split between male and female 
motorcyclists, the number of trips per person and the truncated normal distributions of the
distances and ages of the drivers of the personal motorcycle trips to be added. It creates 
new trips by assuming that each such trip only has one stage, i.e. that the trip duration and distance
equals the stage duration and distance.

This function contains the following steps:
- the characteristics of the motorcycle trips to be added are defined
- set up the parameters of the truncated normal distributions for male and 
  female trip duration
- set up the parameters of the truncated normal distributions for male and 
  female age ranges
- find the number of male and female motorcycle trips to be added
- divide the number of new male and female trips by 2 (= number of trips per person)
  to calculate the number of new participant ids to be added. If the number of male
  or female trips is odd, add an additional trip to get a trip number divisible by 2
- sample from truncated normal distributions to find the duration of new trips (assuming
  that each trip only consists of one stage)
- sample from the known age ranges to find the ages of the new male and female 
  motorcycle trips and create new motorcycle trips
