\description{
Creates a data frame with given characteristics to be added to an existing trip data set.
}
\details{
This function is used to create new trips with certain characteristics that can be added to an existing trip data set.
The input distance given is the upper limit of trip distances added and the function takes the number of trips per 
person (nTrips) random samples between 1 and the input distance given. Age and sex of each participant are also 
sampled from a range of input age and sex values.

The function performs the following steps:
- create nTrips new trips sampling from distances, ages and sexes
