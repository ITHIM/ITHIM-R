    "cape_town", "delhi", "mexico_city", "santiago", "sao_paulo", "vizag"),

\arguments{
\item{cities}{which cities to use}

\item{modes}{which modes to use}

\item{distances}{which distance categories to use}

\item{speeds}{named list of mode speeds (to be applied to all cities)}
}
\value{
data frame of maximum proportions by mode and distance category
}
\description{
Computes the mode shares for the different distance categories and then the maximum mode
share for specified mode types and specified distance categories across specified 
(stored) cities. Used for max mode share scenario generation.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:

\itemize{
\item define the minimum distances in each distance category

\item loop through the pre-defined cities:
   \itemize{
   \item read in trip data and get data into correct format
   
   \item assign distance categories
   
   \item for each distance category and pre-defined mode find the proportional modal share 
     (for each distance category, the proportion of the modes adds up to 100%)
   
   \item if rail trips exist, they are added to the proportion of the bus trips to get one value 
     for public transport
   }
   
\item find the maximum mode shares for each mode and distance category
   
\item for each city print one table showing the mode shares for each distance category    
}
}
