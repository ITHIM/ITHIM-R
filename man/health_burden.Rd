\title{Compute health burden}
\usage{
health_burden(ind_ap_pa, conf_int = F, combined_AP_PA = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{ind_ap_pa}{dataframe of all individuals' relative risks for diseases}

\item{conf_int=F}{logic: whether to include confidence interval from dose response relationships or not}

\item{combined_AP_PA=T}{logic: whether to combine the two exposure pathways (AP and PA) or to compute them independently}
}
\value{
list of dataframes: one for deaths per disease per demographic group and scenario, and likewise for YLLs
}
\description{
Compute health burden for population in scenarios given relative risks for diseases
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:

\itemize{
 \item get the demographic and disease burden (subset of Global Burden of Disease dataset) data
   into the correct formats and join the two datasets  
 
 \item scale the burden data by the CHRONIC_DISEASE_SCALAR to account for bias in the data  
 
 \item split the above dataframe into two dataframes, one for deaths and one 
   for years of life lost (YLLs)  
 
 \item add a demographic index (by age and sex category) to the dataframe containing the
   individual relative risk for different diseases  
 
 \item set the reference and the other scenarios
 
 \item iterate over all disease outcomes:  
   \itemize{
   \item define column names  
   
   \item loop either over 1 or 2 pathways depending on whether both PA and AP are affecting 
     the disease and whether the AP and PA pathways are combined or not:  
     \itemize{
     \item extract the relevant burden of disease for the specific scenario both for YLLs and deaths  
     
     \item find the sum of the relative risks (RR) for the specific disease for each age
       and sex category for the reference scenario   
     
     \item loop through the non-reference scenarios: 
       \itemize{ 
       \item define column names  
       
       \item find the sum of the relative risks (RR) for the specific disease for each age
         and sex category for the non-reference scenario   
       
       \item calculate the PIF (potential impact fraction), i.e the proportional change
         in the sum of relative risks between the reference and the non-reference 
         scenario for each age and sex category  
       
       \item calculate the health burden (deaths and ylls) for the non-reference scenario
         compared to the reference scenario by multiplying the current burden of disease
         by the PIF (combine_health_and_pif.R)
         }
         
     \item if confidence intervals are required, loop through the upper and lower confidence
       interval limits and calculate the health burden for deaths and YLLs using
       the upper and lower confidence relative risks. If no upper and lower relative risk
       values exist, use the median value instead
