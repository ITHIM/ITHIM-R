@article{Elvik2013,
abstract = {Safety-in-numbers denotes a non-linear relationship between exposure (traffic volume) and the number of accidents, characterised by declining risk as traffic volume increases. There is safety-in-numbers when the number of accidents increases less than proportional to traffic volume, e.g. a doubling of traffic volume is associated with less than a doubling of the number of accidents. Hazard-in-numbers, a less-used concept, refers to the opposite effect: the number of accidents increases more than in proportion to traffic volume, e.g. is more than doubled when traffic volume is doubled. This paper discusses whether a safety-in-numbers effect and a hazard-in-numbers effect can co-exist in the same data. It is concluded that both effects can exist in a given data set. The paper proposes to make a distinction between partial safety-in-numbers and complete safety-in-numbers. Another issue that has been raised in discussions about the safety-in-numbers effect is whether the effect found in some studies is an artefact created by the way exposure was measured. The paper discusses whether measuring exposure as a rate or a share, e.g. kilometres travelled per inhabitant per year, will generate a safety-in-numbers effect as a statistical artefact. It is concluded that this is the case. The preferred measure of exposure is a count of the number of road users. The count should not be converted to a rate or to the share any group of road user contribute to total traffic volume. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper reports an analysis of factors influencing safety in a sample of marked pedestrian crossings in the city of Oslo, Norway. The sample consists of 159 marked pedestrian crossings where a total of 316 accidents were recorded during a period of five years. The crossings were selected for inspection because of they were, for various reasons, regarded as sub-standard. The sample of crossings is therefore not representative of all pedestrian crossings in Oslo. Factors influencing the number of accidents were studied by means of negative binomial regression. Factors that were studied included the volume of pedestrians and vehicles, the number of traffic lanes at the crossing, the location of the crossing (midblock or junction), the type of traffic control, the share of pedestrians using the crossing and the speed of approaching vehicles. The analysis confirmed the presence of a "safety-in-numbers" effect, meaning that an increase in the number of pedestrians is associated with a lower risk of accident for each pedestrian. Crossings located in four-leg junctions or roundabouts had more accidents than crossings located in three-leg junctions or on sections between junctions. A high share of pedestrians crossing the road outside the marked crossing was associated with a high number of accidents. Increased speed was associated with an increased number of accidents. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Much of earlier work on predictive models for accidents has been focused on rural traffic or urban intersections. This work has aimed at identifying and investigating possible improvements to predictive models for accidents on urban links. A special focus has been on the accidents of vulnerable road users. The possible improvements investigated have been: a) the use of exposure data for vulnerable road users, b) the use of actual vehicle speeds, c) to separate vehicle accidents into single vehicle and multiple vehicle accidents and model each type separately. The study involved eight Swedish cities, of which six were included in the development of accident models. In addition to police-reported traffic accidents, data for the models were collected in specific field studies and partly from the cities. The study shows that the inclusion of exposure data for vulnerable road users in the models for vulnerable road users? accidents greatly improves the predictive ability of the models. Vehicle speeds were found to be very difficult to use in the models as vehicle speeds are highly correlated with most of the other variables and make the model coefficients unstable. The separate modelling of single and multiple vehicle accidents failed partly as the single vehicle accidents were too few for constructing sound models. The models for multiple vehicle accidents developed, however, had a better predictive ability than models for all vehicle accidents. Land use was the next important explanatory variable for most accident types after the exposure variables. Accident models were developed with one data set and validated with another data set. The models performed very well in prediction by explaining between 71{\%} and 81{\%} of the systematic variation in the validation data. The validation indicated that exponents were 0.5 for both the flows of pedestrians and motor vehicles in models for accidents involving vulnerable road users, and 1.0 for the motor vehicle flow exponent in the models for motor vehicle accidents. For bicyclist accidents the correct exponent for bicyclist flows is likely to be somewhat lower than 0.5, close to 0.35. The study also recommended practical uses for the models, listed the lessons learned from the modelling as well as proposed a number of topics for further research.},

abstract = {Pedestrians are legitimate users of the transportation system, and they should, therefore, be able to use this system safely. Pedestrian needs in crossing streets should be identified, and appropriate solutions should be selected to improve pedestrian safety and access. Deciding where to mark crosswalks is only one consideration in meeting that objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether marked crosswalks at uncontrolled locations are safer than unmarked crosswalks under various traffic and roadway conditions. Another objective was to provide recommendations on how to provide safer crossings for pedestrians. This study involved an analysis of 5 years of pedestrian crashes at 1,000 marked crosswalks and 1,000 matched unmarked comparison sites. All sites in this study had no traffic signal or stop sign on the approaches. Detailed data were collected on traffic volume, pedestrian exposure, number of lanes, median type, speed limit, and other site variables. Poisson and negative binomial regressive models were used. The study results revealed that on two-lane roads, the presence of a marked crosswalk alone at an uncontrolled location was associated with no difference in pedestrian crash rate, compared to an unmarked crosswalk. Further, on multilane roads with traffic volumes above about 12,000 vehicles per day, having a marked crosswalk alone (without other substantial improvements) was associated with a higher pedestrian crash rate (after controlling for other site factors) compared to an unmarked crosswalk. Raised medians provided significantly lower pedestrian crash rates on multilane roads, compared to roads with no raised median. Older pedestrians had crash rates that were high relative to their crossing exposure. More substantial improvements were recommended to provide for safer pedestrian crossings on certain roads, such as adding traffic signals with pedestrian signals when warranted, providing raised medians, speed-reducing measures, and others},

abstract = {The threat of the new pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 imposed a heavy burden on the public health system in Finland in 2009-2010. An extensive vaccination campaign was set up in the middle of the first pandemic season. However, the true number of infected individuals remains uncertain as the surveillance missed a large portion of mild infections. We constructed a transmission model to simulate the spread of influenza in the Finnish population. We used the model to analyse the two first years (2009-2011) of A(H1N1)pdm09 in Finland. Using data from the national surveillance of influenza and data on close person-to-person (social) contacts in the population, we estimated that 6{\%} (90{\%} credible interval 5.1 - 6.7{\%}) of the population was infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 in the first pandemic season (2009/2010) and an additional 3{\%} (2.5 - 3.5{\%}) in the second season (2010/2011). Vaccination had a substantial impact in mitigating the second season. The dynamic approach allowed us to discover how the proportion of detected cases changed over the course of the epidemic. The role of time-varying reproduction number, capturing the effects of weather and changes in behaviour, was important in shaping the epidemic.},

Behavior changes compound this, altering both true dynamics and reporting patterns, particularly for diseases with nonspecific symptoms, such as influenza. We disentangle these effects to unravel the hidden dynamics of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1pdm pandemic in London, where surveillance suggests an unusual dominant peak in the summer. We embed an age-structured model into a bayesian synthesis of multiple evidence sources to reveal substantial changes in contact patterns and health-seeking behavior throughout the epidemic, uncovering two similar infection waves, despite large differences in the reported levels of disease. We show how this approach, which allows for real-time learning about model parameters as the epidemic progresses, is also able to provide a sequence of nested projections that are capable of accurately reflecting the epidemic evolution.},

abstract = {Air pollution is a major risk factor for global health, with both ambient and household air pollution contributing substantial components of the overall global disease burden. One of the key drivers of adverse health effects is fine particulate matter ambient pollution (PM{\$}{\_}{\{}2.5{\}}{\$}) to which an estimated 3 million deaths can be attributed annually. The primary source of information for estimating exposures has been measurements from ground monitoring networks but, although coverage is increasing, there remain regions in which monitoring is limited. Ground monitoring data therefore needs to be supplemented with information from other sources, such as satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth and chemical transport models. A hierarchical modelling approach for integrating data from multiple sources is proposed allowing spatially-varying relationships between ground measurements and other factors that estimate air quality. Set within a Bayesian framework, the resulting Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) is used to estimate exposures, together with associated measures of uncertainty, on a high resolution grid covering the entire world. Bayesian analysis on this scale can be computationally challenging and here approximate Bayesian inference is performed using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations. Model selection and assessment is performed by cross-validation with the final model offering substantial increases in predictive accuracy, particularly in regions where there is sparse ground monitoring, when compared to current approaches: root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 17.1 to 10.7, and population weighted RMSE from 23.1 to 12.1 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}gm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}.

The MET concept represents a simple, practical, and easily understood procedure for expressing the energy cost of physical activities as a multiple of the resting metabolic rate. The energy cost of an activity can be determined by dividing the relative oxygen cost of the activity (ml O2/kg/min) x by 3.5. This article summarizes and presents energy expenditure values for numerous household and recreational activities in both METS and watts units. Also, the intensity levels (in METS) for selected exercise protocols are compared stage by stage. In spite of its limitations, the MET concept provides a convenient method to describe the functional capacity or exercise tolerance of an individual as determined from progressive exercise testing and to define a repertoire of physical activities in which a person may participate safely, without exceeding a prescribed intensity level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two vaccines (Rotarix and RotaTeq) are highly effective at preventing severe rotavirus disease. Rotavirus vaccination has been introduced in the United Kingdom and other countries partly based on modeling and cost-effectiveness results. However, most of these models fail to account for the uncertainty about several vaccine characteristics and the mechanism of vaccine action.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A deterministic dynamic transmission model of rotavirus vaccination in the United Kingdom was developed. This improves on previous models by 1) allowing for 2 different mechanisms of action for Rotarix and RotaTeq, 2) using clinical trial data to understand these mechanisms, and 3) accounting for uncertainty by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the long run, Rotarix and RotaTeq are predicted to reduce the overall rotavirus incidence by 50{\%} (39{\%}-63{\%}) and 44{\%} (30{\%}-62{\%}), respectively but with an increase in incidence in primary school children and adults up to 25 y of age. The vaccines are estimated to give more protection than 1 or 2 natural infections. The duration of protection is highly uncertain but has only impact on the predicted reduction in rotavirus burden for values lower than 10 y. The 2 vaccine mechanism structures fit equally well with the clinical trial data. Long-term postvaccination dynamics cannot be predicted reliably with the data available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Accounting for the joint uncertainty of several vaccine characteristics resulted in more insight into which of these are crucial for determining the impact of rotavirus vaccination. Data for up to at least 10 y postvaccination and covering older children and adults are crucial to address remaining questions on the impact of widespread rotavirus vaccination.},

abstract = {A model's purpose is to inform medical decisions and health care resource allocation. Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value of information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, in terms of both deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.},

abstract = {Decision analytic models used for health technology assessment are subject to uncertainties. These uncertainties can be quantified probabilistically, by placing distributions on model parameters and simulating from these to generate estimates of cost-effectiveness. However, many uncertain model choices, often termed structural assumptions, are usually only explored informally by presenting estimates of cost-effectiveness under alternative scenarios. The authors show how 2 recent research proposals represent parts of a framework to formally account for all common structural uncertainties. First, the model is expanded to include parameters that encompass all possible structural choices. Uncertainty can then arise because these parameters are estimated imprecisely from data, for example, a treatment effect of doubtful significance. Uncertainty can also arise if there are no relevant data. If there are relevant data, uncertainty can be addressed by averaging expected costs and effects generated from probabili...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Achieving health benefits while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport offers a potential policy win-win; the magnitude of potential benefits, however, is likely to vary. This study uses an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM) to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of high walking and cycling transport scenarios for English and Welsh urban areas outside London. METHODS Three scenarios with increased walking and cycling and lower car use were generated based upon the Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project. Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools. RESULTS This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases. CONCLUSIONS Methods to estimate the health impacts from transport related physical activity and injury risk are in their infancy; this study has demonstrated an integration of transport and health impact modelling approaches. The findings add to the case for a move from car transport to walking and cycling, and have implications for empirical and modelling research.},

abstract = {SUMMARY We describe Bayesian hierarchical models and illustrate their use in epidemiological studies of the effects of environment on health. The framework of Bayesian hierarchical models refers to a generic model building strategy in which unobserved quantities (e.g. statistical parameters, missing or mismeasured data, random effects, etc.) are organized into a small number of discrete levels with logically distinct and scientifically interpretable functions, and probabilistic relationships between them that capture inherent features of the data. It has proved to be successful for analysing many types of complex epidemiological and biomedical data. The general applicability of Bayesian hierarchical models has been enhanced by advances in computational algorithms, notably those belonging to the family of stochastic algorithms based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this article, we review different types of design commonly used in studies of environment and health, give details on how to incorporate the hierarchical structure into the different components of the model (baseline risk, exposure) and discuss the model specification at the different levels of the hierarchy with particular attention to the problem of aggregation (ecological) bias.},

abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of determining optimal designs for biological process models with intractable likelihoods, with the goal of parameter inference. The Bayesian approach is to choose a design that maximises the mean of a utility, and the utility is a function of the posterior distribution. Therefore, its estimation requires likelihood evaluations. However, many problems in experimental design involve models with intractable likelihoods, that is, likelihoods that are neither analytic nor can be computed in a reasonable amount of time. We propose a novel solution using indirect inference (II), a well established method in the literature, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm of M{\"{u}}ller et al. (2004). Indirect inference employs an auxiliary model with a tractable likelihood in conjunction with the generative model, the assumed true model of interest, which has an intractable likelihood. Our approach is to estimate a map between the parameters of the generative and auxiliary models, using simulations from the generative model. An II posterior distribution is formed to expedite utility estimation. We also present a modification to the utility that allows the M{\"{u}}ller algorithm to sample from a substantially sharpened utility surface, with little computational effort. Unlike competing methods, the II approach can handle complex design problems for models with intractable likelihoods on a continuous design space, with possible extension to many observations. The methodology is demonstrated using two stochastic models; a simple tractable death process used to validate the approach, and a motivating stochastic model for the population evolution of macroparasites.},

abstract = {Introduction The 'Safety in Numbers' (SiN) phenomenon refers to a decline of injury risk per time or distance exposed as use of a mode increases. It has been demonstrated for cycling using cross-sectional data, but little evidence exists as to whether the effect applies longitudinally -that is, whether changes in cycling levels correlate with changes in per-cyclist injury risks.Methods This paper examines cross-sectional and longitudinal SiN effects in 202 local authorities in Britain, using commuting data from 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses plus police -recorded data on 'killed and seriously injured' (KSI) road traffic injuries. We modelled a log-linear relationship between number of injuries and number of cycle commuters. Second, we conducted longitudinal analysis to examine whether local authorities where commuter cycling increased became safer (and vice versa).Results The paper finds a cross-sectional SiN effect exists in the 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses. The longitudinal analysis also found a SiN effect, that is, places where cycling increased were more likely to become safer than places where it had declined. Finally, these longitudinal results are placed in the context of changes in pedestrian, cyclist and motorist safety. While between 1991 and 2001 all modes saw declines in KSI risk (37{\%} for pedestrians, 36{\%} for cyclists and 27{\%} for motor vehicle users), between 2001 and 2011 pedestrians and motorists saw even more substantial declines (41{\%} and 49{\%}), while risk for cyclists increased by 4{\%}.Conclusion The SiN mechanism does seem to operate longitudinally as well as cross-sectionally. However, at a national level between 2001-11 it co-existed with an increase in cyclist injury risk both in absolute terms and in relation to other modes.},

We report age- and sex-specific deaths and injury rates from equivalent incidents in England by travel mode, distance travelled and time spent travelling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Hospital admissions and deaths in England 2007-2009 were obtained for relevant ICD-10 external codes for pedestrians, cyclists, and car/van drivers, by age-group and sex. Distance travelled by age-group, sex and mode in England (National Travel Survey 2007-2009 data) was converted to time spent travelling using mean trip speeds. Fatality rates were compared with age-specific Netherlands data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All-age fatalities per million hours' use (f/mhu) varied over the same factor-of-three range for both sexes (0.15-0.45 f/mhu by mode for men, 0.09-0.31 f/mhu for women). Risks were similar for men aged 21-49 y for all three modes and for female pedestrians and drivers aged 21-69 y. Most at risk were: males 17-20 y (1.3 f/mhu (95{\%} CI 1.2-1.4)) for driving; males 70+ (2.2 f/mhu(1.6-3.0)) for cycling; and females 70+ (0.95 f/mhu (0.86-1.1)) for pedestrians. In general, fatality rates were substantially higher among males than females. Risks per hour for male drivers {\textless}30 y were similar or higher than for male cyclists; for males aged 17-20 y, the risk was higher for drivers (33/Bn km (30-36), 1.3 f/mhu (1.2-1.4)) than cyclists (20/Bn km (10-37), 0.24 f/mhu (0.12-0.45)) whether using distance or time.

We characterised more fully the impact of driving and cycling on road traffic fatalities by including deaths to all the other road users in fatal car or cycle crashes. We used crash data from the Great Britain National Road Accident Database (STATS19) and exposure data from the National Travel Survey. Rates were estimated as the ratio of fatalities to the amount of time travelled: fatalities per million hours' use (f/mhu). Rates in 2005-07, 2008-10, and 2011-13 were calculated based on deaths to: (1) the drivers or cyclists themselves (persons 'in charge' of vehicles), (2) other, i.e. 'third-party', road users (e.g. passengers, drivers or riders of other vehicles, and pedestrians), and (3) both of these groups combined, i.e. all road users. Rates were stratified by the sex and age of the drivers or cyclists involved in the fatal crashes.Rates based on deaths to persons in charge of vehicles were higher for cyclists than for drivers, whereas those based on deaths to third-party road users showed the opposite. The inclusion of third-party deaths increased the overall rates considerably more for drivers than for cyclists. Nevertheless, the overall rate for male cyclists (2011-13: 0.425. f/mhu; 95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI): 0.377-0.478) exceeded that for male drivers (0.257. f/mhu; 95{\%} CI: 0.248-0.267).

These differences between cars and cycles were overestimated as the safer travel on motorways could not be disaggregated in the estimates for driving. The higher rates for cycling - mainly borne by the cyclists themselves - need to be balanced against the substantially lower risks to other road users.},

abstract = {Several recent transportation safety studies have indicated the importance of accounting for correlated outcomes, for example, among different crash types, including differing injury-severity levels. In this paper, we discuss inference for such data by introducing a flexible Bayesian multivariate model. In particular, we use a Dirichlet process mixture to keep the dependence structure unconstrained, relaxing the usual homogeneity assumptions. The resulting model collapses into a latent class multivariate model that is in the form of a flexible mixture of multivariate normal densities for which the number of mixtures (latent components) not only can be large but also can be inferred from the data as part of the analysis. Therefore, besides accounting for correlation among crash types through a heterogeneous correlation structure, the proposed model helps address unobserved heterogeneity through its latent class component. To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose and apply such a model in the transportation literature. We use the model to investigate the effects of various factors such as built environment characteristics on pedestrian and cyclist injury counts at signalized intersections in Montreal, modeling both outcomes simultaneously. We demonstrate that the homogeneity assumption of the standard multivariate model does not hold for the dataset used in this study. Consequently, we show how such a spurious assumption affects predictive performance of the model and the interpretation of the variables based on marginal effects. Our flexible model better captures the underlying complex structure of the correlated data, resulting in a more accurate model that contributes to a better understanding of safety correlates of non-motorist road users. This in turn helps decision-makers in selecting more appropriate countermeasures targeting vulnerable road users, promoting the mobility and safety of active modes of transportation.},

Methods: Using ONS (cycling, pedestrian) and Stats19 (driving) 2007-2012 data for travel-related deaths, including pedestrian falls, and National Travel Surveys 2007-2012 travel data, we calculated fatality rates for England by distance (f/bnkm) and time travelled (million hours' use, f/mhu) by age, travel mode, and gender or residential Index of Multiple Deprivation. Results: Fatality rates fell significantly 2007-2009 to 2010-2012: male f/bnkm from 2.8 (95{\%}CI 2.7-2.9) to 2.0 (1.9-2.1) for driving; 32.1 (28.5-36.0) to 20.8 (18.1-23.9) for cycling; and 51.4 (48.5-54.4) to 36.7 (34.3-39.3) for walking. Fatality rates varied by age, gender, and mode. Driving and walking fatality rate ratios were generally higher for males than females. For males 17-20y, fatality rates were 0.76 (0.69-0.83)/mhu for driving and 0.28 (0.18-0.42)/mhu for cycling but were similar by distance. Age-specific rates were J-shape for cycling, U-shape for driving, and increased exponentially with age for walking. Fatality rates aged 80+ were an order of magnitude higher in each mode than the all-age mean. Compared with those aged 17-20, rate ratios were significantly lower for male drivers 21+ and female drivers 21-74, but were higher for male cyclists aged 55+ and pedestrians 45+ (male) and 65+ (female). People living in the most deprived quintile generally had higher fatality rates than those in the least deprived quintile overall (three modes combined) and for walking but not for cycling; Rate ratios were highest for pedestrians 35-64 and drivers 35-54. Conclusions: Fatality rates for walking, cycling and driving are higher for males than females at almost every age and vary more by age than by travel mode.

Nevertheless, the overall rate for male cyclists (2011-13: 0.425. f/mhu; 95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI): 0.377-0.478) exceeded that for male drivers (0.257. f/mhu; 95{\%} CI: 0.248-0.267). A similar pattern was observed for females (cycling: 0.216. f/mhu; 95{\%} CI: 0.158-0.287; driving: 0.127. f/mhu; 95{\%} CI: 0.120-0.135). These differences between cars and cycles were overestimated as the safer travel on motorways could not be disaggregated in the estimates for driving. The higher rates for cycling - mainly borne by the cyclists themselves - need to be balanced against the substantially lower risks to other road users.},

@article{Elvik2013,
abstract = {Safety-in-numbers denotes a non-linear relationship between exposure (traffic volume) and the number of accidents, characterised by declining risk as traffic volume increases. There is safety-in-numbers when the number of accidents increases less than proportional to traffic volume, e.g. a doubling of traffic volume is associated with less than a doubling of the number of accidents. Hazard-in-numbers, a less-used concept, refers to the opposite effect: the number of accidents increases more than in proportion to traffic volume, e.g. is more than doubled when traffic volume is doubled. This paper discusses whether a safety-in-numbers effect and a hazard-in-numbers effect can co-exist in the same data. It is concluded that both effects can exist in a given data set. The paper proposes to make a distinction between partial safety-in-numbers and complete safety-in-numbers. Another issue that has been raised in discussions about the safety-in-numbers effect is whether the effect found in some studies is an artefact created by the way exposure was measured. The paper discusses whether measuring exposure as a rate or a share, e.g. kilometres travelled per inhabitant per year, will generate a safety-in-numbers effect as a statistical artefact. It is concluded that this is the case. The preferred measure of exposure is a count of the number of road users. The count should not be converted to a rate or to the share any group of road user contribute to total traffic volume. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Goicoa2016,
abstract = {Mortality counts are usually aggregated over age groups assuming similar effects of both time and region, yet the spatio-temporal evolution of cancer mortality rates may depend on changing age structures. In this paper, mortality rates are analyzed by region, time period and age group, and models including space-time, space-age, and age-time interactions are considered. The integrated nested Laplace approximation method, known as INLA, is adopted for model fitting and inference in order to reduce computing time in comparison with Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods. The methodology provides full posterior distributions of the quantities of interest while avoiding complex simulation techniques. The proposed models are used to analyze prostate cancer mortality data in 50 Spanish provinces over the period 1986-2010. The results reveal a decline in mortality since the late 1990s, particularly in the age group [65,70), probably because of the inclusion of the PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test and better treatment of early-stage disease. The decline is not clearly observed in the oldest age groups. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a unified framework for a Bayesian analysis of incidence or mortality data in space and time. We introduce four different types of prior distributions for space x time interaction in extension of a model with only main effects. Each type implies a certain degree of prior dependence for the interaction parameters, and corresponds to the product of one of the two spatial with one of the two temporal main effects. The methodology is illustrated by an analysis of Ohio lung cancer data 1968-1988 via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the fit and the complexity of several models with different types of interaction by means of quantities related to the posterior deviance. Our results confirm an epidemiological hypothesis about the temporal development of the association between urbanization and risk factors for cancer.},

abstract = {The partial expected value of perfect information (EVPI) quantifies the expected benefit of learning the values of uncertain parameters in a decision model. Partial EVPI is commonly estimated via a 2-level Monte Carlo procedure in which parameters of interest are sampled in an outer loop, and then conditional on these, the remaining parameters are sampled in an inner loop. This is computationally demanding and may be difficult if correlation between input parameters results in conditional distributions that are hard to sample from. We describe a novel nonparametric regression-based method for estimating partial EVPI that requires only the probabilistic sensitivity analysis sample (i.e., the set of samples drawn from the joint distribution of the parameters and the corresponding net benefits). The method is applicable in a model of any complexity and with any specification of input parameter distribution. We describe the implementation of the method via 2 nonparametric regression modeling approaches, the Generalized Additive Model and the Gaussian process. We demonstrate in 2 case studies the superior efficiency of the regression method over the 2-level Monte Carlo method. R code is made available to implement the method.},

abstract = {Suppose we have a Bayesian model which combines evidence from several different sources. We want to know which model parameters most affect the estimate or decision from the model, or which of the parameter uncertainties drive the decision uncertainty. Furthermore we want to prioritise what further data should be collected. These questions can be addressed by Value of Information (VoI) analysis, in which we estimate expected reductions in loss from learning specific parameters or collecting data of a given design. We describe the theory and practice of VoI for Bayesian evidence synthesis, using and extending ideas from health economics, computer modelling and Bayesian design. The methods are general to a range of decision problems including point estimation and choices between discrete actions. We apply them to a model for estimating prevalence of HIV infection, combining indirect information from several surveys, registers and expert beliefs. This analysis shows which parameters contribute most of the uncertainty about each prevalence estimate, and provides the expected improvements in precision from collecting specific amounts of additional data.},

@article{Brennan2007,
abstract = {Partial expected value of perfect information (EVPI) calcu- lations can quantify the value of learning about particular subsets of uncertain parameters in decision models. Pub- lished case studies have used different computational approaches. This article examines the computation of partial EVPI estimates via Monte Carlo sampling algo- rithms. The mathematical definition shows 2 nested expectations, which must be evaluated separately because of the need to compute a maximum between them. A gen- eralized Monte Carlo sampling algorithm uses nested simulation with an outer loop to sample parameters of interest and, conditional upon these, an inner loop to sample remaining uncertain parameters. Alternative com- putation methods and shortcut algorithms are discussed and mathematical conditions for their use considered. Maxima of Monte Carlo estimates of expectations are biased upward, and the authors show that the use of small samples results in biased EVPI estimates. Three case studies illustrate 1) the bias due to maximization and also the inaccuracy of shortcut algorithms 2) when correlated variables are present and 3) when there is nonlinearity in net benefit functions. If relatively small correlation or non- linearity is present, then the shortcut algorithm can be substantially inaccurate. Empirical investigation of the numbers of Monte Carlo samples suggests that fewer sam- ples on the outer level and more on the inner level could be efficient and that relatively small numbers of samples can sometimes be used. Several remaining areas for meth- odological development are set out. A wider application of partial EVPI is recommended both for greater understand- ing of decision uncertainty and for analyzing research priorities.},

abstract = {Several studies show that the risks of injury to pedestrians and cyclists are highly non-linear. This means that the more pedestrians or cyclists there are, the lower is the risk faced by each pedestrian or cyclist. On the other hand, the more motor vehicles there are, the higher becomes the risk faced by each pedestrian or cyclist. The relationships found in previous studies suggest that if very large transfers of trips from motor vehicles to walking or cycling take place, the total number of accidents may be reduced. The "safety in numbers" effect for pedestrians and cyclists would then combine favourably with the effect of a lower number of motor vehicles to produce a lower total number of accidents. This paper explores if such an effect is possible, relying on the findings of studies that show the non-linearity of injury risks for pedestrians and cyclists. It is found that for very large transfers of trips from motor vehicles to walking or cycling, a reduction of the total number of accidents is indeed possible. This shows that the high injury rate for pedestrians and cyclists in the current transport system does not necessarily imply that encouraging walking or cycling rather than driving will lead to more accidents. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health impact assessment (HIA) studies are increasingly predicting the health effects of mode shifts in traffic. The challenge for such studies is to combine the health effects, caused by injuries, with the disease driven health effects, and to express the change in the health with a common health indicator. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) combines years lived disabled or injured (YLD) and years of life lost (YLL) providing practical indicator to combine injuries with diseases. In this study, we estimate the average YLDs for one person injured in a transport crash to allow easy to use methods to predict health effects of transport injuries. METHODS: We calculated YLDs and YLLs for transport fatalities and injuries based on the data from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA). In STRADA, all the fatalities and most of the injuries in Sweden for 2007-2011 were recorded. The type of injury was recorded with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes. In this study these AIS codes were aggregated to injury types, and YLDs were calculated for each victim by multiplying the type of injury with the disability weight and the average duration of that injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying the age of the victim with life expectancy of that age and gender. YLDs and YLLs were estimated separately for different gender, mode of transport and location of the crash. RESULTS: The average YLDs for injured person was 14.7 for lifelong injuries and 0.012 for temporal injuries. The average YLDs per injured person for lifelong injuries for pedestrians, cyclists and car occupants were 9.4, 12.8 and 18.4, YLDs, respectively. Lifelong injuries sustained in rural areas were on average 31{\%} more serious than injuries in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that shifting modes of transport will not only change the likelihood of injuries but also the severity of injuries sustained, if injured. The results of this study can be used to predict DALY changes in HIA studies that take into account mode shifts between different transport modes, and in other studies predicting the health effects of traffic injuries.},

abstract = {Health economic decision-analytic models are used to estimate the expected net benefits of competing decision options. The true values of the input parameters of such models are rarely known with certainty, and it is often useful to quantify the value to the decision maker of reducing uncertainty through collecting new data. In the context of a particular decision problem, the value of a proposed research design can be quantified by its expected value of sample information (EVSI). EVSI is commonly estimated via a 2-level Monte Carlo procedure in which plausible data sets are generated in an outer loop, and then, conditional on these, the parameters of the decision model are updated via Bayes rule and sampled in an inner loop. At each iteration of the inner loop, the decision model is evaluated. This is computationally demanding and may be difficult if the posterior distribution of the model parameters conditional on sampled data is hard to sample from. We describe a fast nonparametric regression-based method for estimating per-patient EVSI that requires only the probabilistic sensitivity analysis sample (i.e., the set of samples drawn from the joint distribution of the parameters and the corresponding net benefits). The method avoids the need to sample from the posterior distributions of the parameters and avoids the need to rerun the model. The only requirement is that sample data sets can be generated. The method is applicable with a model of any complexity and with any specification of model parameter distribution. We demonstrate in a case study the superior efficiency of the regression method over the 2-level Monte Carlo method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Partial expected value of perfect information (EVPI) calcu- lations can quantify the value of learning about particular subsets of uncertain parameters in decision models. Pub- lished case studies have used different computational approaches. This article examines the computation of partial EVPI estimates via Monte Carlo sampling algo- rithms. The mathematical definition shows 2 nested expectations, which must be evaluated separately because of the need to compute a maximum between them. A gen- eralized Monte Carlo sampling algorithm uses nested simulation with an outer loop to sample parameters of interest and, conditional upon these, an inner loop to sample remaining uncertain parameters. Alternative com- putation methods and shortcut algorithms are discussed and mathematical conditions for their use considered. Maxima of Monte Carlo estimates of expectations are biased upward, and the authors show that the use of small samples results in biased EVPI estimates. Three case studies illustrate 1) the bias due to maximization and also the inaccuracy of shortcut algorithms 2) when correlated variables are present and 3) when there is nonlinearity in net benefit functions. If relatively small correlation or non- linearity is present, then the shortcut algorithm can be substantially inaccurate. Empirical investigation of the numbers of Monte Carlo samples suggests that fewer sam- ples on the outer level and more on the inner level could be efficient and that relatively small numbers of samples can sometimes be used. Several remaining areas for meth- odological development are set out. A wider application of partial EVPI is recommended both for greater understand- ing of decision uncertainty and for analyzing research priorities.},

abstract = {Over recent years Value of Information analysis has become more widespread in health-economic evaluations, specifically as a tool to perform Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis. This is largely due to methodological advancements allowing for the fast computation of a typical summary known as the Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information (EVPPI). A recent review discussed some estimations method for calculating the EVPPI but as the research has been active over the intervening years this review does not discuss some key estimation methods. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive review of these new methods. We begin by providing the technical details of these computation methods. We then present a case study in order to compare the estimation performance of these new methods. We conclude that the most recent development based on non-parametric regression offers the best method for calculating the EVPPI efficiently. This means that the EVPPI can now be used practically in health economic evaluations, especially as all the methods are developed in parallel with R},

Learning their structure and intricacies is fraught with challenges, and often side-stepped in favour of studying the function of different gene products in isolation from their physiological context. Constructing and inferring global mathematical models from experimental data is, however, central to systems biology. Different experimental setups provide different insights into such systems. Here we show how we can combine concepts from Bayesian inference and information theory in order to identify experiments that maximize the information content of the resulting data. This approach allows us to incorporate preliminary information; it is global and not constrained to some local neighbourhood in parameter space and it readily yields information on parameter robustness and confidence. Here we develop the theoretical framework and apply it to a range of exemplary problems that highlight how we can improve experimental investigations into the structure and dynamics of biological systems and their behavior.},

These trips would mostly otherwise have been made on foot (31{\%}) or by public transport (47{\%}). To date there has been a trend towards fewer fatalities and injuries than expected on cycle hire bicycles. Using these observed injury rates, the population benefits from the cycle hire scheme substantially outweighed harms (net change -72 DALYs (95{\%} credible interval -110 to -43) among men using cycle hire per accounting year; -15 (-42 to -6) among women; note that negative DALYs represent a health benefit). When we modelled cycle hire injury rates as being equal to background rates for all cycling in central London, these benefits were smaller and there was no evidence of a benefit among women (change -49 DALYs (-88 to -17) among men; -1 DALY (-27 to 12) among women). This sex difference largely reflected higher road collision fatality rates for female cyclists. At older ages the modelled benefits of cycling were much larger than the harms. Using background injury rates in the youngest age group (15 to 29 years), the medium term benefits and harms were both comparatively small and potentially negative.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: London's bicycle sharing system has positive health impacts overall, but these benefits are clearer for men than for women and for older users than for younger users. The potential benefits of cycling may not currently apply to all groups in all settings.},

abstract = {Great cities connect people; failed cities isolate people. Despite the fundamental importance of physical, face-to-face social ties in the functioning of cities, these connectivity networks are not explicitly observed in their entirety. Attempts at estimating them often rely on unrealistic over-simplifications such as the assumption of spatial homogeneity. Here we propose a mathematical model of human interactions in terms of a local strategy of maximizing the number of beneficial connections attainable under the constraint of limited individual travelling-time budgets. By incorporating census and openly available online multi-modal transport data, we are able to characterize the connectivity of geometrically and topologically complex cities. Beyond providing a candidate measure of greatness, this model allows one to quantify and assess the impact of transport developments, population growth, and other infrastructure and demographic changes on a city. Supported by validations of gross domestic product and human immunodeficiency virus infection rates across US metropolitan areas, we illustrate the effect of changes in local and city-wide connectivities by considering the economic impact of two contemporary inter- and intra-city transport developments in the UK: High Speed 2 and London Crossrail. This derivation of the model suggests that the scaling of different urban indicators with population size has an explicitly mechanistic origin.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimating the burden of disease attributable to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in ambient air requires knowledge of both the shape and magnitude of the relative risk (RR) function. However, adequate direct evidence to identify the shape of the mortality RR functions at the high ambient concentrations observed in many places in the world is lacking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: We developed RR functions over the entire global exposure range for causes of mortality in adults: ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC). We also developed RR functions for the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) that can be used to estimate mortality and lost-years of healthy life in children {\textless} 5 years of age.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We fit an integrated exposure-response (IER) model by integrating available RR information from studies of ambient air pollution (AAP), second hand tobacco smoke, household solid cooking fuel, and active smoking (AS). AS exposures were converted to estimated annual PM2.5 exposure equivalents using inhaled doses of particle mass. We derived population attributable fractions (PAFs) for every country based on estimated worldwide ambient PM2.5 concentrations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The IER model was a superior predictor of RR compared with seven other forms previously used in burden assessments. The percent PAF attributable to AAP exposure varied among countries from 2 to 41 for IHD, 1 to 43 for stroke, {\textless} 1 to 21 for COPD, {\textless} 1 to 25 for LC, and {\textless} 1 to 38 for ALRI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We developed a fine particulate mass-based RR model that covered the global range of exposure by integrating RR information from different combustion types that generate emissions of particulate matter. The model can be updated as new RR information becomes available.},

Sensitivity analysis can help in identifying critical control points, prioritizing additional data collection or research, and verifying and validating a model. Ten sensitivity analysis methods, including four mathematical methods, five statistical methods, and one graphical method, are identified. The selected methods are compared on the basis of their applicability to different types of models, computational issues such as initial data requirement and complexity of their application, representation of the sensitivity, and the specific uses of these methods. Applications of these methods are illustrated with examples from various fields. No one method is clearly best for food-safety risk models. In general, use of two or more methods, preferably with dissimilar theoretical foundations, may be needed to increase confidence in the ranking of key inputs.},

abstract = {The authors have performed a structured expert judgement study of the population mortality effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. The opinions of six European air pollution experts were elicited. The ability of each expert to probabilistically characterize uncertainty was evaluated using 12 calibration questions-relevant variables whose true values were unknown at the time of elicitation, but available at the time of analysis. The elicited opinions exhibited both uncertainty and disagreement. It emerged that there were significant differences in expert performance. Two combinations of the experts' judgements were computed and evaluated-one in which each expert's views received equal weight; the other in which the expert's judgements were weighted by their performance on the calibration variables. When the performance of these combinations was evaluated the equal-weight combination exhibited acceptable performance, but was nonetheless inferior to the performance-based combination. In general, the experts agreed with published studies for the best estimate of all-cause mortality from PM2.5; however, as would be expected, they gave confidence intervals that were several times broader than the statistical confidence intervals taken directly from the most frequently cited published studies. The experts were rather comfortable with applying epidemiological results from one geographic region to another. However, there was more uncertainty and disagreement about issues of timing of the effect and about the relative toxicity of different constituents of PM2.5. Even so, the experts were in fairly good agreement that an appreciable fraction of the long-term health effects occurs within a few months after the exposure and that combustion-derived particles are more toxic than PM2.5on average, while secondary sulphates, nitrates and/or crustal materials may be less toxic. These assessments bring very valuable and relevant information to air pollution risk assessment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Experts agree that value of information (VOI) analyses provide useful insights in risk management decisions. However, applications in environmental health risk management (EHRM) remain largely demonstrative thus far because of the complexity in modeling and solving VOI problems. Based on this comprehensive review of all VOI applications published in the peer-reviewed literature of such applications, the complexity of solving VOI problems with continuous probability distributions as inputs in models emerges as the main barrier to greater use of VOI although simulation allows analysts to solve more complex and realistic problems. Several analytical challenges that inhibit greater use of VOI techniques include issues related to modeling decisions, valuing outcomes, and characterizing uncertain and variable model inputs appropriately. This comprehensive review of methods for modeling and solving VOI problems for applications related to EHRM provides the first synthesis of important methodological advances in the field. The insights provide risk analysts and decision scientists with some guidance on how to structure and solve VOI problems focused on evaluating opportunities to collect better information to improve EHRM decisions. They further suggest the need for some efforts to standardize approaches and develop some prescriptive guidance for VOI analysts similar to existing guidelines for conducting cost-effectiveness analyses.},

@article{Miranda-Moreno2011,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach to represent cyclist risk exposure. This approach considers disaggregate motor vehicle and cyclist flows and develops cyclist injury frequency models. Three definitions of risk exposure were used in this research, including aggregated flows, motor vehicle flows aggregated by movement type, and potential conflicts between motor vehicles and cyclists. As an application environment, a large sample of signalized intersections on the island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, was used, along with data that comprised disaggregate motor vehicle and cyclist flows. Several negative binomial models were fitted to the data. This study showed that cyclist collisions were sensitive to changes in both cyclist and motor vehicle flows. A 10{\%} increase in bicycle flow was associated with a 4.4{\%} increase in the frequency of cyclist injuries. A 10{\%} increase in the total number of motor vehicles that passed through the intersection would result in a 3.4{\%} increase in cyclist injury occurrence. When motor vehicle flows were considered on the basis of movement type, right-turn movements had a great effect on injury occurrence. Similar results, which identified right turns as having the greatest effect on cyclist injuries, were produced when the impact of potential conflicts was determined. The number of bus stops in the proximity of the intersection increased cyclist injury occurrence. Some geometric design factors, such as the presence of a median, parking entrance, and the number of intersection legs, were tested. The effect, however, was found to be statistically nonsignificant.},

abstract = {This paper adds material to the ongoing body of literature exploring the effect of pedestrian volume on safety for pedestrians. Observed and existing data for 247 intersections in Oakland, California, were used to model the effect of pedestrian volume on the number and rate (number of collisions per pedestrians) of vehicle—pedestrian collisions at or near these intersections. The study used a data set containing pedestrian collisions, average annual pedestrian volume, average annual vehicle volume, and other intersection characteristics. Estimates of the model parameters show that the number of pedestrian collisions increases more slowly than the number of pedestrians; that is, the collision rate decreases as the number of pedestrians increases, consistent with previous studies by Leden and Jacobsen. Specifically, a doubling of the number of pedestrians (increase of 100{\%}) is associated with only a 52{\%} increase in the number of vehicle-pedestrian collisions, with the corresponding rate decreasing by about 24{\%}. If further research shows this association to be causal, and not due to variation in intersection characteristics or selection factors involving pedestrian choice, the implications for policy and planning involving pedestrians are substantial.},

@article{Garder1998,
abstract = {Before-and-after study methodology was developed and applied to eval-uating the effect on bicyclists' safety of raising urban bicycle crossings by 4 to 12 cm. In total, 44 junctions were reconstructed in this way in Gothenburg, Sweden. Four of these were studied in detail. Before the implementations, bicyclists were riding either in the roadway or on sep-arate paths parallel to the roadway. The paths then ended with short ramps or curb cuts at each cross street, and bicyclists used nonelevated, marked bicycle crossings, similar to pedestrian crosswalks but delin-eated by white painted rectangles rather than zebra stripes. The results show that the paths with raised crossings attracted more than 50 percent more bicyclists and that the safety per bicyclist was improved by approx-imately 20 percent due to the increase in bicycle flow, and with an addi-tional 10 to 50 percent due to the improved layout. However, the increased bicyclist volume means that the total number of bicycle acci-dents is expected to increase. Besides accident analysis, the change in risk was estimated using four different methods: surveys of bicyclists and experts, respectively; conflict data; and a quantitative expert model. Using a Bayesian approach for combining the results shows that the most likely effect of raising the bicycle crossing is a risk reduction of around 30 percent, compared with the before situation with a conventional bicy-cle crossing. Motorists and pedestrians also saw safety benefits from this traffic-calming measure. The city of Gothenburg, Sweden—population around 450,000— has since 1992 spent approximately 30 million SKr (around U.S. {\$}5 million) annually on bicycle facilities and specific measures aimed at improving the safety of bicyclists. This has given us a unique opportunity to use before-and-after studies for evaluating the safety effects of different measures. This paper focuses on such a measure: elevating bicycle crossings to a level similar to sidewalks (so-called speed tables) and giving them red pavement to further accentuate them. A typical example of an elevated bicycle crossing is shown in Figure 1. As can be observed, the pedestrian crossing is elevated as well—as a continuous sidewalk across the minor approach. Some of the crossings were raised by as much as 12 cm, having 20-cm-long ramps for crossing automobiles; others were raised by only 4 to 6 cm, having almost vertical, mountable curbs. All the bicycle " paths " run parallel to major streets (typically minor arterials), and the elevated crossings are all across minor streets. The area studied, consisting of 18.7 km of sections and 44 inter-sections (shown in Figure 2), had a total of 126 bicycle accidents reported by police or hospitals in the 5-year period 1988–1992. This large number of accidents initiated the changes in layout. None of the accidents were fatal, but many involved serious injuries. Bicycle-vehicle accidents as well as bicycle-pedestrian accidents were much more frequent here than in Gothenburg as a whole, whereas single bicycle accidents accounted for only 47 percent of all bicycle acci-dents in this area as opposed to 64 percent for the city as a whole. Bicycle-pedestrian accidents accounted for 10 percent here compared with 1 percent of all bicycle accidents citywide. Bicycle-bicycle accidents accounted for 7 percent here as well as citywide. In 1993, practically all bicycle crossings along these 18.7 km were elevated. There are 44 intersections in the study area:},

abstract = {"Safety in Numbers"(SIN), a recent concept in transportation research, policy and planning, has emerged as a causal inference from the non-linear statistical association between estimates of the numbers of walkers or bicyclists in an area and the rate or number of traffic collisions experienced by pedestrians or cyclists. Proponents of SIN argue that greater numbers of walkers or cyclists modify the hazardous behaviors of motor vehicle drivers thus creating safer conditions. This paper critically examines the research on the non-linear association as an adequate empirical basis for this causal interpretation. Given the paucity of evidence supporting a specific mechanism for the SIN effect, alternative plausible explanations of the non-linear association behind SIN, and a potential for unintended consequences from its policy application, the authors call for caution in the use of SIN in transportation policy and planning dialogue and decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
